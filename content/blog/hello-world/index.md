This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

Even though flex has been in the run for quite alot of time now, the grid system was introduced to lower the pain of designing the layout.

Implemention of a flex is during the procedure of defining UI components whereas grids are used for the layout of the page.


## Compatibility

Full Support : FF52+,Chrome 57+,Safari 10.1+,Opera 44+,iOS Safari, Chrome for Android 59+, FF Andriod 55+,Edge 16.

Partial Support: IE 10,IE 11,Edge 12-15.

No Support: Mostly Mobile browsers. But that's not a major concern as we always stackup the content.

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
