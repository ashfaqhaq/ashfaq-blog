So yeah now that i have started learning JS, i will be documenting the process and the vanilla JS!

Js is backwards compatible, therefore ensuring that all legacy code will work 100% fine, whereas on the other hand it is not forward compatible, being forwards-compatible means that including a new addition to the language in a program would not cause that program to break if it were run in an older JS engine.

For Example: A new feature from ES2019 running in an old browser which uses ES2016  is likely to crash !

HTML and CSS are forward compatible languages but not backward compatible, trailing the programmer to re-write the same code if required. Coming to its forward compatibility, the browser version from 2010 running features of 2020 will not crash the website, instead it will just skip the unidentified syntax.

Yeah, I didn't either.
